Inspired by the excellent
https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/convey[GoConvey] framework,
we have endeavored to create a similar framework for C programmers.
This work was done in support of testing for a rewrite of
https://github.com/nanomsg/nanomsg[nanomsg].

Easily Readable & Writeable Tests
---------------------------------

Each Convey() block is run on its own, with the entire of Convey's
in which it is nested restarted from the beginning.  It also has
support for clean Reset(), allowing test pre-conditions to be reset
between each set.

Easily Readable Output
----------------------

The output is colored if yout terminal supports it, and tests can include
extra debugging messages that will be inlined in the log in the appropriate
calling order.  (The test log is suppressed by default, and the above image
shows a verbose, output, without the full debugging log.)  The output above
was generated by the demo.c program in this repository.
