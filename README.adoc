C Convey Testing Framework
==========================

Inspired by the excellent
https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/convey[GoConvey] framework,
we have endeavored to create a similar framework for C programmers.
This work was done in support of testing for a rewrite of
https://github.com/nanomsg/nanomsg[nanomsg].

This work is very preliminary at this point, and subject to change
frequently.  More documentation will be forthcoming.
